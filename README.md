# ReactJS Concepts Challenge

![Build](https://github.com/cjcbusatto/rocketseat-studies-reactjs-concepts/workflows/Build%20process/badge.svg?branch=master)

## ðŸš€ Introduction

In this challenge, you should develop a simple application to interact with the API previously developed ([here](https://github.com/cjcbusatto/rocketseat-studies-node-concepts)).

## Application Features

- List the repositories from the API
  - Your frontend application should show the repositories `title` as a list.
- Add a repository to the API
  - Your frontend application should add a new repository to the API through a button `Add`. This repository can contain random data, no problem. Remember, once you click in the button, you should also display this new repository in the list of repositories.
- Remove a repository in the API
  - For each item in the list, you should also include a `Remove` button. Once the button is clicked, the repository is removed in the API and the list in the frontend gets updated.
